# Calendar Application in C++

## Project Overview

The Calendar Application is a sophisticated tool built in C++ that allows users to securely log in and access personalized calendars. The application offers the ability to view calendars for specific months and years, manage events, and interact with a clean, user-friendly interface. The system supports leap years, provides event management features, and employs best practices in object-oriented programming (OOP) to ensure maintainability, scalability, and efficiency.

## Key Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Secure login system requiring a unique account number and password for each user.
- Passwords are validated to ensure only authorized users can access their personalized calendars.

### 2. **Calendar Generation**
- Users can generate and view calendars for any given year and month.
- Accurate handling of leap years and month-specific days ensures precise calendar rendering.

### 3. **Event Management**
- Add, edit, and remove events for specific dates.
- Events are stored with associated date-time validation to ensure accuracy.
- View all events for a given day with clear, organized display.

### 4. **Leap Year and Date Handling**
- Automatically calculates leap years, ensuring February 29 is displayed in applicable years.
- Robust algorithms are used to determine the number of days in each month and the starting day of the month.

### 5. **Command-Line Interface**
- Intuitive CLI with easy-to-understand prompts and error handling for user input.
- Clear, concise messages guide the user through authentication, calendar viewing, and event management.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The primary programming language used due to its efficiency and control over system resources, ideal for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project adheres to OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the codebase.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Calendar Application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdalvihasanemon/calendar-app.git
   ```

2. **Ensure a C++ Compiler is Installed**:
   - You can use GCC, Clang, or any C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.

3. **Build the Application**:
   Navigate to the project directory and compile the source code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o calendar_application main.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   After successful compilation, execute the program:
   ```bash
   ./calendar_application
   ```

## Usage

### 1. **Login**:
   - Upon starting the application, users will be prompted to enter their unique account number and password.
   - The system will authenticate the provided credentials, granting access to the personalized calendar.

### 2. **Calendar Viewing**:
   - Users can view the calendar for any specific year or month.
   - The calendar correctly handles leap years and displays the days of the week aligned with the respective dates.
   - Navigation through months and years is straightforward.

### 3. **Event Management**:
   - Add events by specifying the date and event details.
   - The application will validate the entered date and ensure events are correctly added.
   - Events can be edited or removed, and the user is notified of successful changes.

### 4. **Event Viewing**:
   - Once events are added to specific dates, users can easily view all events scheduled for a particular day.
   - Events are displayed in an organized manner, making it easy to review.

## Design and Architecture

### **Class Structure**
- The system utilizes an object-oriented approach with a base `Calendar` class that provides common calendar functionalities. Specific implementations are provided for different years (e.g., `Calendar2024`) to handle year-specific logic such as leap years and monthly configurations.

### **Data Structures**
- **Arrays**: Used for storing user credentials, calendar days, and events efficiently.
- **Strings**: Used to store user input (e.g., passwords, events) and to provide flexible interaction with the user.
- **Structs**: Employed to encapsulate event details, making it easier to manage and retrieve events.

### **Algorithms**
- **Leap Year Calculation**: A dedicated algorithm checks whether a given year is a leap year, ensuring February has 29 days where applicable.
- **Days in Month**: A function calculates the number of days in a given month based on the year and month number, adjusting for leap years in February.
- **Start Day of Month**: A mathematical formula determines the starting day of the week for any given month and year.

## Challenges and Solutions

### **1. Date Validation**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring accurate date-time input validation and ensuring it matches the expected format while considering edge cases such as leap years.
   - **Solution**: Implemented a robust validation mechanism that checks for valid days, months, and years, and provides appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

### **2. User Interface**
   - **Challenge**: Designing an effective CLI within the constraints of a command-line interface while ensuring ease of use and error-free interaction.
   - **Solution**: The interface is designed with user prompts and clear messages, including error-handling mechanisms that guide users through any mistakes.

## Future Enhancements

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Transitioning from the CLI to a GUI using frameworks like Qt or GTK to enhance user interaction.
- **Recurring Events**: Adding functionality to support recurring events (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Cloud Integration**: Allow users to sync their calendars and events across multiple devices through cloud storage.
- **Event Notifications**: Implementing notifications and reminders for upcoming events.
